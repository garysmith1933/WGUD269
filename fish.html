    <h1>Fish</h1>
    <p> 
      Fish represent a broad class of aquatic animals that can live in fresh or saltwater, depending on the species. 
      Bringing fish into your home can be an exciting hobby, especially if you intend to breed them, and the presence of a fish tank in your home can induce feelings of peace and tranquility.
      <br><br>
      Whether you are bringing your fish home for the first time or maintaining your aquarium, it is important to test your water once per week to ensure it is free from toxins that can harm your fish.

    <li>Ammonia: any level above 0.1 ppm requires attention</li>
    <li>Nitrates: 10 to 40 ppm</li>
