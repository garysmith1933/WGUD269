  <h1>Evidence-based pet care advice for every pet lover</h1>
  <p> Pets are nature's gift to humanity.

At Pet Paradigm Professionals, our mission is to offer resources to help you care for your furry, scaly, feathery, and slimy loved ones. Our pet experts—or “Pexperts”—have been working with pet owners and professionals alike for the past twelve years. 
  They offer one-on-one consultations with current and prospective pet owners as well as group presentations designed for veterinary, pet shelter, and pet breeding professionals.</p>
